# Haptic_MapElevation
HCI project that implemented Lécuyer’s pseudo-haptics interaction technique that allows “feeling bumps and holes” when moving cursor on a 2D map.

# How to use it
Choose the map as you like from the right menu panel. After the map fully loaded, move your cursor around the surface to feel whether it gives you haptic feelings.
