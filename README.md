# Haptic_MapElevation
HCI project that implemented Lécuyer’s pseudo-haptics interaction technique that allows “feeling bumps and holes” when moving cursor on a 2D map.

# How to use it?
Just move your cursor around the surface to feel whether it gives you haptic feelings like mountains, valleys and cliffs.

# How it works?
It makes the user's cursor invisible, then paint the new display cursor with JavaScript.
